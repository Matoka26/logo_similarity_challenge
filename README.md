  - LA: 1911/3356
- crop:
  - LA: good separation, noise: 1794/3356, a lot better for AAMCO
  - RGBA: noise 1935/3356
- blur + crop: not a big inorivement, around 2300 images as noise, 1000 grouped, mostly overfit
  - RGBA
  - LA: 203 groups and a lot of noise, bad
- blur + crop + noise:
  - RGBA: found 217groups but around 3/4 was consideres noise, bad
